# norah - A Twickets Crawler

A simple node app I made to search for Norah Jones tickets for my partner. Reading online it seems that Twickets' own alert system is slightly delayed and highly contended by various other fans desperate to get face-value tickets, your best bet is to constantly refresh the feed.

**norah.js** will crawl over the top 3 elements in the Twickets feed every 10 seconds

## Usage

Clone this repository.

`cd` into the root directory and then...

```
npm install
```

OR

```
bun install
```

```
cp .env.emample .env
```

Edit the `.env` or overwrite any settings you want in a .env.local file.
Make sure to include your personal Google App Password or SMTP credentials.

Once ready run...
```
node norah.js
```

OR

```
bun norah.js
```

Leave it running in the background and await an email with subject **Ticket Available**.

Take that normies! ðŸ¤“
